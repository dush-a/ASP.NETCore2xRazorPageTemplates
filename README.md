# ASP.NET Core Starter Templates

In this solution there are 2 ASP.NETCore Razor Pages starter web application projects. The target framework is ASP.NET core 2.x

Also, It uses the default bootstrap framework for UI.

These templates are created using Default Visual Studio ASP.NET Core Razor pages web template with individual user authentication and then modified with more commonly used web site features

Additional Features included in this template:

### Scroll to top Button
Added necessary code to show up scroll to top button at the bottom left corner of the page.

### Sticky Navigation Bar
The navigation bar is visible always at the top of the page.

### Use System Variables
Shows how to use system variables in the Razor pages. The demonstration can be found on the `About` page. for detailed information check the code behind page model.

### Bootstrap Carousel
The bootstrap carousel was available with the previously ASP.NET core 2.1 templates. So I have added it here with modified bootstrap code to match the version used in this template.

And more features to come ..

# How to use this template:

Fork or create a branch or download the code to your computer and open using any version of Visual Studio 2017. I used Visual Studio 2017 Community Edition.

Then to suit your requirement, change the namespaces in the entire solution using "Find and replace" (Ctrl +H).

You may also need to change the http, and https port numbers for the project. You can change it directly in the "lanchSetting.json" file.
