# ASP.NETCoreTemplates

This template uses ASP.NET Core Razor Pages Framework.
Also, It uses the default bootstrap framework for UI.

The template is created using ASP.NET Core Razor pages web template with individual user authentication

Additional Features included in this template:

### Scroll to top Button
Added necessary code to show up scroll to top button at the bottom left corner of the page.

### Sticky Navigation Bar
The navigation bar is visible always at the top of the page.

### Use System Variables
Shows how to use system variables in the Razor pages. The demonstration can be found on the page.

### Bootstrap Carousel
The bootstrap carousel was available with the previously ASP.NET core 2.1 templates. So I have added it here with modified bootstrap code to match the version used in this template.
