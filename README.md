# How to use this template:

Fork or create a branch or download the code to your computer and open using any version of Visual Studio 2017. I used Visual Studio 2017 Community Edition.

Then to suit your requirement, change the namespaces in the entire solution using "Find and replace" (Ctrl +H).

You may also need to change the http, and https port numbers for the project. You can change it directly in the "lanchSetting.json" file.
